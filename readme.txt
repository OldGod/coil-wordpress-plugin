Enables support for Coil in WordPress.

== Description ==

We change the way you monetize content on the web!

We think our idea is pretty rad, but it’s really not that radical. It comes from a belief that all people deserve effortless commerce.

Coil exists because content monetization doesn’t work for everyone, and we think it should. Our model offers an alternative to the status quo of paid advertisements and selling the public’s attention to the highest bidders – A solution that will serve the people who aren’t being served well today.

Coil for WordPress allows you to set any post or page for monetization either for all readers, subscribers only or if you are using the Gutenberg editor, you can monetize at the block level.
